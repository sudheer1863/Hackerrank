# HackerRank Solutions 🚀

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains all the **HackerRank problems** I’ve solved across different domains.  
You’ll find solutions implemented in multiple programming languages, including:  

- 🐍 Python  
- ☕ Java  
- 💻 C  
- ➕➕ C++  
- 🗄️ SQL  
- 🔧 And many more...  

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific domain or programming language.  
Inside, you’ll find my solutions neatly organized with clear filenames.  

## 🎯 Purpose
The aim of this repo is to:  
- Track my coding journey on HackerRank.  
- Help others learn by sharing solutions in different languages.  
- Serve as a reference for revising algorithms, data structures, and database queries.  

## ⚠️ Note
These solutions are for **learning and reference only**.  
I highly encourage you to try solving the problems on your own first before checking the code here.  

## 💡 Contribution
If you spot a mistake, have a better approach, or want to add solutions in another language, feel free to open a pull request.
